## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter (stable channel)
- Dart SDK >= 3.9.2
- Android SDK + device/emulator (Android 8.0+ recommended)

### Setup

1. Install dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

2. Run on a device

```bash
flutter run
```

First launch performs an initial repository sync and caches data locally for faster subsequent loads and limited offline use.

```bash
flutter build apk --split-per-abi
```
